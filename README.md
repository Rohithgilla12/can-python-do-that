# `can python do that`

Hey everyone, I wanted to start a new series in [DEV](https://dev.to/) with name can python do that.

This series aims to cover python libraries which are amazing and beginner friendly. As a part of this series I will include 3 libraries every week.

This repository will include 
- Demo Codes (if available)
- Short note on the library

## Repository structure
Every folder will be named with `Week <number>`, and inside that there would be sub folders with `Library` names.
For example, say `Week 2`, I discussed about *Streamlit*, *PyLyrics*, *PDFMiner*

```
can-python-do-that
│   README.md
|
└───Streamlit
│   │   main.py
│   │   poetry.lock
|   |   poetry.toml
|   |   README.md
│   │
└───PyLyrics
│   │   main.py
│   │   poetry.lock
|   |   poetry.toml
|   |   README.md
│   │
└───PDFMiner
│   │   main.py
│   │   poetry.lock
|   |   poetry.toml
|   |   README.md
│   │
```

## How to run the codes in the folder
Every folder uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) as packaging and dependency manager.

### Installing dependencies

```bash
poetry install
```

### Running the shell within the virtual environment
```bash
poetry shell
```
### Exiting the environment
```bash
exit
```
