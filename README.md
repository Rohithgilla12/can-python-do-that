# `can python do that`

Hey everyone, I wanted to start a new series in [DEV](https://dev.to/) with name can python do that.

This series aims to cover python libraries which are amazing and beginner friendly. As a part of this series I will include 3 libraries every week.

This repository will include 
- Demo Codes (if available)
- Short note on the library

## Repository structure
Every folder will be named with `Week <number>`, and inside that there would be sub folders with `Library` names.
For example, say `Week 2`, I will be discussing about *Streamlit*, *PyLyrics*, *PDFMiner*

```
can-python-do-that

│   │   main.py
│   │   poetry.lock
|   |   poetry.toml

└───PyLyrics
